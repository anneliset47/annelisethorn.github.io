        <p>The Introduction is 5+ paragraphs were a paragraph is at least 10 sentences. 
          The Intro should also have images to help the reader to understand your topic area. 
          An Introduction (example of paragraph 1 below) is 100% non-technical and gives the reader a background, basis, understanding, foundation, and motivation for your topic. 
          Do not include anything about models or methods, datasets, etc. 
          This area is only about the topic, what it is, why it matters, who it affects, what has been done so far, what can still be done. etc. </p>
        <h3>10 Questions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Can a machine learning model determine whether a genetic variant is harmful?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Which features, such as variant frequency or genomic location, are most helpful in predicting whether a variant is harmful?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Which machine learning model—logistic regression, decision tree, or neural network—tends to perform best for this kind of prediction?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Does using more features generally lead to more accurate predictions?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Can a model trained on one population group still perform well when applied to a different group?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Does including conservation scores improve the accuracy of the model’s predictions?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Which features does the model find most important when making its predictions?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Can genetic variants be grouped into clusters based on their shared features?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>How well does the model perform when some of the feature data is missing or noisy?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
            <li>Does the model perform better on certain types of variants, like missense compared to synonymous?</li>
            <!-- ... -->
