        <h3>Topic: Predicting the Pathogenicity of Genetic Variants</h3>
        <p>“Almost every human trait and disease has a genetic component” (Genetic Alliance, 2009). 
          Every living organism is made up of cells, which contain DNA. 
          DNA acts as a set of instructions for all of the activities in the organism. 
          In human cells, DNA is packaged in larger units called chromosomes. 
          Each human typically contains 23 pairs of chromosomes; one pair of which are sex chromosomes (XX or XY). 
          Each chromosome contains segments of DNA, known as genes. 
          Genes encode for proteins and other functional molecules to carry out biological processes. 
          Small changes in DNA are referred to as genetic variants or mutations. 
          Some variants are harmless, while others can cause disease. 
          Understanding which genetic variants are harmful is crucial for the diagnosis and prevention of diseases. 
          Everyone has genetic variants, such as variations in eye color. 
          However, not everyone has pathogenic genetic variants.</p>

        <p>“A typical human genome contains roughly 4 to 5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and around 2,100 to 2,500 structural variants, such as large deletions or insertions” (Sabeti, 1970). 
          One type of structural variant is tandem repeats, which is when one or more nucleotides are repeated adjacent. 
          Several tandem repeat genetic variants are known to cause disease, like Huntington’s Disease and Fragile X Syndrome. 
          However, several tandem repeats have not been claimed as harmless or harmful; scientists call these variants of unknown significance (VUS). 
          VUSs can be frustrating for doctors and patients as doctors are left unsure how to treat and advise patients. 
          This uncertainty can cause anxiety, delays in treatment, or even incorrect diagnoses. 
          Additionally, different labs may interpret VUSs differently, leading to confusion for doctors and patients. 
          To help patients get clear results and better treatment options, it is essential to create better tools to understand VUSs. 
          Predicting which variants are harmful can play a critical role in medical genomics today. </p>
        <p>This problem is particularly important, because VUSs have serious consequences for patients and the healthcare system.
          When pathogenic or likely pathogeic variants are identified, patients can receive early diagnoses, appropriate medical care, and preventative measures.
          For example, if a healthy individual is found to have a pathogenic variant, like BRCA1, they can take proactive measures to monitor their health and reduce their risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
          On the other hand, if a harmful variant is misclassified or not understood, the opportunity for early intervention is lost and patients may face unnecessary risks.
          Not only is this a burden on patients, but it also places a strain on healthcare systems.
          Misclassifying variants can lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments, and increased healthcare costs.
          Additionally, understanding the pathogenicity of genetic variants can help researchers identify new disease mechanisms and develop targeted therapies.
          By accurately predicting the pathogenicity of genetic variants, we can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and advance the field of medical genomics.
          As genetic testing becomes more accessible and affordable, the need for accurate predictions of variant pathogenicity will only grow.
          Without being able to accurately predict the pathogenicity of genetic variants, the full benefits of genetic testing cannot be realized.
        </p>
        <p>Over the past two decades, scientists have made significant progress in developing computational tools and databases to interpret genetic variants. 
          Tools such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MutationTaster predict whether DNA changes might disrupt protein function by analyzing evolutionary conservation, biochemical properties, and known disease associations (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Ng & Henikoff, 2003; Schwarz et al., 2014). 
          Databases like ClinVar and gnomAD collect and share information about variants, categorizing them based on clinical and population data (Landrum et al., 2018; Karczewski et al., 2020). 
          These resources have greatly improved variant interpretation and helped link genetic changes to disease. Machine learning models have further advanced this field by using large datasets to predict variant impact with increasing accuracy (Ioannidis et al., 2016; Sundaram et al., 2018). 
          However, many current tools are tailored for single nucleotide variants and may struggle with more complex alterations such as tandem repeats (Dolzhenko et al., 2017). 
          Inconsistencies between tools can also complicate interpretation, requiring expert review to ensure accuracy. 
          To overcome these limitations, researchers are developing next-generation models that integrate diverse genomic information. 
          Better understanding of gene regulation is also being incorporated to enhance predictive power. 
          Standardized clinical guidelines, like those from the ACMG, aim to bring consistency and reliability to variant classification (Richards et al., 2015).</p>

        <p>Predicting whether a genetic variant is harmful is a complex challenge that requires a well-rounded strategy. A big part of the solution involves improving how data is shared between research institutions, hospitals, and genetic testing companies. When more information is available for each variant, especially from diverse populations, machine learning models can make more accurate predictions.
        It’s also important to upgrade existing tools to better handle complex variants, like tandem repeats, which are often missed or misinterpreted. Researchers are already starting to include structural variant analysis in routine workflows, which is a promising step forward.
        Stronger collaboration among clinicians, geneticists, and bioinformaticians can help refine how variants are classified. Creating open-source platforms where experts can share their interpretations could reduce inconsistencies between different labs.
        At the same time, incorporating experimental methods like CRISPR-based assays can back up computational predictions with real-world data. And improving public understanding of genetics can help patients feel more confident about their results.
        Bringing together better technology, stronger collaboration, and broader education makes it possible to move toward more accurate and equitable genomic medicine.</p>
        <h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Can a machine learning model determine whether a genetic variant is harmful?</strong><br />
              A machine learning model can recognize patterns in genetic data that suggest whether a variant might be harmful. In this project, even simple inputs like the gene name were enough for a model to correctly identify all the harmful variants in the test set. This shows that there is predictive signal in the data and that machine learning can be a useful tool for identifying high-risk variants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Which features, such as variant frequency or genomic location, are most helpful in predicting whether a variant is harmful?</strong><br />
              The gene name turned out to be one of the most helpful features in this case. Some genes are more commonly associated with disease, so just knowing where a variant is located can already offer a lot of information. It is likely that other features like conservation scores or allele frequency would be just as useful or even more informative, but those were not included in this version of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Which machine learning model tends to perform best for this kind of prediction?</strong><br />
              The neural network performed the strongest in terms of accuracy. It was able to correctly classify all pathogenic variants in the test set. However, it misclassified all of the non-pathogenic ones, which showed that accuracy alone does not always reflect true performance. Other models like Naive Bayes were more balanced, even if they were slightly less accurate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Does using more features generally lead to more accurate predictions?</strong><br />
              Using more features tends to improve performance, especially when they provide new or complementary information. In this project, only a few features were used, and the results suggest that adding more detailed or biologically meaningful features would likely make the predictions more accurate and reliable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Can a model trained on one population group still perform well when applied to a different group?</strong><br />
              This was not directly tested, but models trained on a single population may not perform as well on a different group. Variant frequencies can vary across populations, and that could affect how the model behaves. A more balanced training set that includes global diversity would be more likely to generalize well.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Does including conservation scores improve the accuracy of the model’s predictions?</strong><br />
              Conservation scores were not used in this version of the project, but they are known to be strong predictors in other studies. Regions of the genome that are conserved across species are more likely to be important, so changes in those regions often signal risk. Including conservation data would probably improve the model’s predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Which features does the model find most important when making its predictions?</strong><br />
              In the current setup, the only input to the model was the encoded gene name. Even with that, the model picked up on some strong signals. With more features, tools like feature importance plots or SHAP values could be used to figure out which ones have the most impact on the model’s decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Can genetic variants be grouped into clusters based on their shared features?</strong><br />
              Yes, clustering helped group variants based on shared symptoms. These groupings made it easier to spot patterns in the data that were not obvious just by looking at individual rows. Clustering also helped reveal how some variants might be linked by common traits, which could be helpful for future classification tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How well does the model perform when some of the feature data is missing or noisy?</strong><br />
              The models were trained only on entries that had complete data. When working with missing or noisy data, performance tends to drop unless the model is designed to handle it. In future versions, strategies like data imputation or more robust architectures could help reduce this problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Does the model perform better on certain types of variants, like missense compared to synonymous?</strong><br />
              Variant type was not included as a feature, so this was not tested directly. Still, other studies have shown that models usually perform better on certain types like missense mutations, which tend to have more visible effects. Adding variant type to the feature set would be a useful next step to explore how predictions vary across types.
